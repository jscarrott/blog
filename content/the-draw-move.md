So it turns out that your baby needs to sleep in the same room as you for the first few months. Not the worst idea but, our room didn't have enough room for our clothes and a baby... So the clothes had to move, aftr a complete rearrange of our spare bedroom to accomodate the new drawers. 

It's amazing how much time you can sepnd doing simple things when moving around a room, just simple things like trying to sort out that small box of stuff that has been moving around unsorted for years seems to take soo much time. It's  the objects that mean slightly too much to discard but don't have any place to live that are the absolute worst.
