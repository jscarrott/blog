# What to write about?

I have thought about writing a blog before and in the distant past I did write one, but I always seemed to put so much effort into each post that it became a huge labour to keep going. I'll try and keep this one simple and concise to make it easy to keep up to date.

# Topics
With the baby on the way I may write about my trials and tribulations as my life changes. I may write small bits about code, probably rust.

I was thinking about doing a photo series of objects that were important to me that day through the early days with the baby, shifting the focus away from just posting pictures of a child too young to consent to having their image shared.

If I get a decent amount of content I may replace my website with this.
